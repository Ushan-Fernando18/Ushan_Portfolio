                        <hr>
                        <p>I am Ushan Fernando. I studied at St.Peters College Colombo 04.A dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a strong foundation in web development. 
                            My ultimate goal is to have a significant effect in the field of AI and data science, with an emphasis on both professional and personal development. 
                            I have developed my front-end and back-end web development abilities as an undergraduate trainee.
                             I work best in fast-paced, dynamic settings where I can constantly learn new things and adjust to new difficulties.
                              I want to eventually assume more significant positions that allow me to use my artificial intelligence skills.
                               The chance to work with varied teams and contribute to creative solutions that promote good change inspires me.
                                I'm dedicated to producing outcomes that go above and beyond, whether that means directing cross-functional projects,
                                 carrying out strategic plans, or boosting operational effectiveness. I am keen to contribute to the development of data science and am enthusiastic about its future. I am motivated by the prospect of collaborating with diverse teams and taking on impactful roles. 
                            Whether it's implementing cutting-edge technologies or optimizing processes, I am committed to delivering exceptional results.</p>
                          

                            <h2>Education</h2>
                            <hr>
                        <p>From a young age, I developed a keen interest in technology and problem-solving. I attended St. Peter's College, Colombo 04, 
                            where I successfully completed my Ordinary Level examinations with 7 A's and 2 B's, and my Advanced Level examinations in the Physical Science stream.
                             Building on this solid basis, I attended the University of Westminster to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
                             I was able to learn more about the complexities of software development and the possibilities of cutting-edge technology thanks to this encounter.
                              Technology's future excites me, and I can't wait to contribute to creative projects that improve the world.
                             The idea of working with various teams and assuming challenging tasks inspires me.</p>
